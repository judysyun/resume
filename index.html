        <h2>Welcome to my resume !<br><br></h2>
        <p>In a typical scenario, any applicant for a job must prove to the employer 
            they are valuable enough for an interview. But this is no typical application.
            What if this time, the employer had to prove themselves instead? Is Sid Lee 
            worthy of having the privilege of even getting to see my resume? <!--Does Sid Lee 
            have what it takes? Is Sid Lee good enough?--><br><br></p>        
        <p>You're definitely wondering if I even have what it takes to work at Sid Lee. 
            But I want to know, do you have what it takes to recruit Judy Yun?<br><br></p>
        <p>So, here's how it works. In order to prove yourself and, as a reward, reveal different 
            elements of my resume, you must solve a small puzzle or complete a simple task.
            You may only enter the next level when the previous one is completed.</p>
        <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
